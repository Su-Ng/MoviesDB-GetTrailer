# MoviesDB-GetTrailer
This is a really fun project Python to extract data using API calls and to get movie posters, trailers and display popular movies in a histogram. This is part of my learning journey at ISS where I attended a course NICF- Python for Data, Ops and Things. The skills learnt here really helped to pave the way towards learning how to extract Data and use Panda library to represent the data in a table format, and plot a histogram.
