# MoviesDB-GetTrailer
This is a really fun project Python to extract data using API calls and to get movie posters, trailers and display popular movies in a histogram. This is part of my learning journey at ISS where I attended a course NICF- Python for Data, Ops and Things. The skills learnt here really helped to pave the way towards learning how to extract Data and use Panda library to represent the data in a table format, and plot a histogram. Along the way, I learnt so many interesting features of Python, in particular, I would like to share in this repository, how to display youtube trailers using a drop down list of titles. A really cool thing to do. All the work done here is made possible by The Movie Database(TMDb). Many thanks to our wonderful instructor, Bala and everyone in the course. I share this picure of everyone who was in the course with me, learning together and sharing our pain and joy in this meaningful learning journey.
